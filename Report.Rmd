# Introduction

# Outcome categorization

The binary response was related with a cow being healthy or unhealthy. Taking this into considertation, the outcome was categorized using the following criteria:

* [Literature review][]*: A healthy cow is estimated to have a PCV value ranging from 24 to 46.
* Practical Modeling: As the binary response should be modeled in following sections, a suitable one was searched. To this end, a trial and error with a cutoff ranging from 20 to 24 was explored.

The threshold between healthy and unhelathy cow was set at a PCV value of 22. If the PCV value was bigger it was categorized as healthy, if it was lower or equal it was cathegorized as unhelathy.

# Statistical methods

The methods used in the statistical analyses are detailed in this section. First a Generalized Estimating Equations and latter a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. An exploratory data analysis was performed before those regression methods.
